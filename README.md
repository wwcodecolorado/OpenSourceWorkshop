## üìñ What is this workshop about?
This workshop is for people who want to contribute to open source but didn't know where to start. 

Come to this workshop to learn:
- How to find an open source project
- How to select a good first issue
- How to submit your first PR using Git

You will have a chance to meet maintainers of open source projects in the following languages: iOS/Swift, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and possibly others.

The maintainers will be available to assign issues for those interested, which means you will walk away from the workshop starting your first open source issue.

## üíü Are you a OS Maintainer?
We are looking for Open Source maintainers of various programming language repositories who are able to spare some time during the workshop date and time. 
Specifically, we are interested if the maintainer would be available to do the following:‚†Ä
- be available on the WWCode Colorado slack on the day of the workshop to assign issues to folks that request them, if not available on Slack, can they send us a few issues they‚Äôve reserved in advance for us so that the WWCode volunteers can assign issues at the workshop‚†Ä
- have beginner-friendly issues available to do the assigning‚†Ä
- follow up with assignees to help them get their PRs reviewed and hopefully, ultimately merged (that might not all happen on the same day).
If this awesome person is you or someone you know, let us know by emailing us at denver@womenwhocode.com or reaching out to any of our social media channels.‚†Ä
